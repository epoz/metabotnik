    <h1>Thanks for joining!</h1>

    <p>An email has been sent to the developer of this site with the exciting news that a new user has registered.</p>

    <p>Before you can proceed, <em>your account has to be manually activated</em>. This is to help us manage the resources on the server, we do not want griefers to come mess up things while we have not battened the hatches yet.</p>

    <p>I will enable your account asap if I recognise your email, otherwise feel free to get in touch for more information at info@metabotnik.com</p>

    <p>regards,<br> Etienne</p>
