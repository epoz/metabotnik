    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <p>These are in the process of being asked - by you! Please mail us your questions, and we shall add them to this list: info@metabotnik.com</p>

    <h3>Can I delete the files in my Dropbox once the metabotnik has been made?</h3>
    <p>Yes! When you make a metabotnik, the files are copied from your Dropbox on to the Metabotnik server. You can then free up space on your Dropbox again if you like.</p>

    <h3>Who can see my projects?</h3>
    <p>A metabotnik is only visible to other users once you tick the 'Published' box. You can uncheck it at any time to hide it again.</p>
